# SS1100: Intro to Programming for Space Applications
## Final Project: Programming Spacecraft Systems

### Assignment
- **Instructions**: Work in groups of four to complete the steps outlined in the project instructions.
- **Submission**: All of your submission will go here in this repository, to include this README file to hold your writeup.

### Procedure
#### Preparation
- Employ programming skills to solve problems related to spacecraft subsystems.
- Develop code and responses to tasks in various sections.
- Experience working with code and collaborating on a coding project.

#### Requirements
1. Complete all tasks listed in each section, paying attention to the Evaluation subsections.
2. Use MatLab to complete at least one of the tasks.
3. Submit the project using GitHub, replacing the content of this README file with your writeup and presentation of the work.

#### Subsystems and Tasks
Reaction Control Subsystem (RCS): Malfunction detection and velocity change calculation.\
Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS): Temperature control function.\
Attitude Control Subsystem (ACS): Attitude determination and rotation calculations.\
Command and Data Handling (C&DH): Command parsing and routing.\
Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS): Power budget analysis and battery charging calculations.\
Remote Sensing Payload: Data ingestion, radiance to reflectance conversion, and image rescaling.

#### Project Writeup (Update as we go)
1. What was your experience in collaborating? Talk about what steps you used to ensure the
inputs from group members worked - code testing, GitHub branch management, etc. - and
how you divided up the workload for the project.

GitHub desktop was helpful when working with PyCharm.  Pycharm community function enabled opening the code directly into Pycharm to edit.  

3. What was the most challenging section, and why? Feel free to provide more than one response
if there is a difference of opinion in the group.

ACS section was difficult because it was hard to decipher what the end goal actually was.  The other difficult apart of ACS was that it required import of code and functions from other python script.  Where the code was located and and CWD gave us trouble because we did not undertand the functionality of CWD.  

5. If you employed Generative AI tools, how did you do so? Discuss which tools you used, the
prompts you utilized, how you ensured the results were valid, and how you integrated the code
into your tasks.

ACS- ChatGPT 4o.  Gave many prompts based on tasking.  From there would give it step by step delinieated tasks that I wanted to see happen.  I would try the small portions and see if they worked as intended.  IF they did not I replied with errors or incorrect outputs.  With so many tasks within ACS it was important to give it instructions one at a time.  If to much was instruction was given mistakes would compound themselves and I would have to start form the top once again. 

7. What other resources did you use to find solutions? Online sites, books, references, etc.

ACS- I looked up what CWD and its funcionality via Google because it was giving me the hardest time.  I also watched Youtube videos on how Github worked and how to update Github from the destop app. 
   
9. In what way could this project be improved for future quarters?
